This project implements a custom memory allocator in C to gain deep understanding of heap management, memory layout, fragmentation, and performance tradeoffs.

The allocator evolves through multiple iterations, starting from a simple arena allocator and progressing to a free-list–based allocator with alignment support and benchmarking.

The goal is not to replace malloc, but to understand how allocators work at a low level and how design choices impact performance and memory usage.
